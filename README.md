# Multisensory-Interactions - The Body Controller

Blending physical inputs with digital feedback to create richer, more human-centered experiences.

Body Tilt Controlled Navigation using MPU6050 + Unity

This project explores hands-free interaction using body inclination as control input.

Hardware:
- Arduino
- MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyro

Interaction Mapping:
- Forward lean → Camera forward
- Side tilt → Rotation

This demonstrates alternative embodied input for virtual environments.
